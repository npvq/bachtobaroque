# Short (Temp) Synopsis:

This is a side project for BachToBaroque because the website portion is proving difficult for me (as I have no webdev experience).

I built this nifty app in `PySimpleGUI` (wonderful package) to demonstrate some of the more advanced uses of the algorithm, and for others to be able to try it out without going through the trouble of command line interfaces.

This app is compiled with the `py2app` package *for MacOS*. Windows users can try "pyInstaller," or simply, run it from source after installing `PySimpleGUI` and `music21` (and related dependencies). This app was developed and tested in Python 3.9.
